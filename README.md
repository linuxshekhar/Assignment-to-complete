Where Script is devided into 3 parts

	1. Install NGINX, Mysql, PHP and elinks
	2. Download Wordpress (latest.tar.gz)
	3. Configure Wordpress for Domains

The idea behind this kind of devidation is, Once we install NGINX, MySql, PHP and Download Wordpress TAR, then we can directly go from the 3rd option.

Cause we already know that first 2 options are already done.

So we can save that time and prevent unwanted log printing. 

Thank you
